# configs
These are reference configurations that have been validated using IOSv images (VIRL images running on EVE-NG), unless otherwise indicated.

Configurations serve as text references for:
- speed drill practice
- validation of a working, proven configuration in the lab
- quick reference new builds, POCs, or even production troubleshooting
